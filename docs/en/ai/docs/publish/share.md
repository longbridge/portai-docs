# Sharing Feature

## Function Description

The sharing feature is used to make **published ChatFlow Agents** available to more users.

Through sharing, you can allow an Agent to be:

* Used only within a specified range
* Or open to everyone


## Supported Sharing Methods

### Public Use

When a ChatFlow Agent is set to **Public**:

* **Anyone can use the Agent**
* It is no longer restricted to workspace members
* Suitable for general-purpose, example, or tool-type Agents

### Publish to App Marketplace

On top of making it public, you can choose to:

* **Publish the ChatFlow Agent to the App Marketplace**
* For other users to browse, select, and use

Agents in the App Marketplace:

* Can be used directly by different users
* Do not affect the original workspace or editing permissions


## Usage Instructions

* Only **published ChatFlow Agents** support sharing
* Sharing does not expose the Agent's internal flows or configurations
* Users can only use the Agent and do not have editing permissions


## Usage Recommendations

* Before making it public, ensure the Agent's behavior is stable and output is reasonable
* General capability Agents are better suited for publishing to the App Marketplace
* Internal or experimental Agents are recommended for private use only


## One-sentence Summary

> **The sharing feature turns a ChatFlow Agent from a "personal tool" into a "reusable public capability."**
