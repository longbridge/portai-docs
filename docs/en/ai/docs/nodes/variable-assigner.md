# Variable Assigner

## What is it?

The Variable Assigner is used to **create, modify, or override variable values within the workflow**.
It allows you to **explicitly control variable content** during workflow execution, rather than relying on implicit outputs from models or tools.

You can think of it as:

> **"The place where you manually set or update variables in the flow."**

## What can you do with it?

#### 1. Create New Variables

You can use the Variable Assigner to:

* Define new workflow variables
* Set initial or default values for variables
* Save calculation results as reusable data

Examples:

* Setting status flags
* Initializing counters
* Generating intermediate result variables

---

#### 2. Modify Existing Variables

The Variable Assigner can:

* Override variables generated by upstream nodes
* Generate new values based on existing variables
* Set different variable states in different branches

This is very common in conditional branches or loops.

---

#### 3. Control Workflow Status

Through the Variable Assigner, you can:

* Mark the current status of the workflow
* Control the basis for loops or conditional judgments
* Explicitly express "progress" or "result status" within the flow

## Input and Output

* **Input**:
  * Can reference any existing workflow variables
* **Output**:
  * Updated set of variables
  * Variables can be used directly by subsequent nodes

## Usage Rules

* Variable names must be unique (within the same scope)
* New assignments will override the old values of variables with the same name
* The assigner itself does not perform complex logic reasoning

## Usage Recommendations

* Use the Variable Assigner for **clear, controllable status modifications**
* Avoid implicitly changing critical variables in model outputs
* It is recommended to centralize the modification of key workflow variables in assigners for easier troubleshooting
* Variable naming should be semantically clear to avoid ambiguity

## Typical Scenarios

* Setting workflow execution status (e.g., success / failed)
* Marking different result results in conditional branches
* Updating counts or accumulating results in loops
* Organizing complex node outputs into unified variables

## When Should You Not Use It?

* Only need to use a node output temporarily
* Not concerned with long-term reuse of the variable
* Need complex calculations or reasoning (should use Code or LLM nodes)

## Difference from Other Nodes (Quick Understanding)

| Node | Main Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| Variable Assigner | Explicitly set / modify variables |
| Code Node | Execute deterministic calculations |
| LLM Node | Reasoning and generation |
| Parameter Extractor | Extract variables from text |

## Quick Reference (Just remember this)

> **The Variable Assigner is not about "calculation," but about "control."**
> Use it to make workflow status and data changes **visible and manageable**.
