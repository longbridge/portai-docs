# Iteration Node

## What is it?

The Iteration node is used to **process a set of data item by item**.
It breaks down "collection-type data" (such as arrays or lists) into multiple elements and **repeatedly executes the same sub-workflow in order**.

You can think of it as:

> **"Running the same process for every item in the list."**

## What can you do with it?

#### 1. Batch Process Data

The Iteration node is ideal for:

* Traversing lists
* Batch generating results
* Executing the same logic for each item

Examples:

* Generating answers separately for multiple questions
* Analyzing search results one by one
* Performing format conversion on a group of data

#### 2. Reuse a Single Flow for Multiple Data Items

You only need to design the processing logic once, and the Iteration node will help you automatically repeat it.

## How it Works (For Understanding)

1. Input a list-type variable
2. Take out one element at a time
3. Execute the sub-workflow connected within the Iteration node
4. Collect the results of each execution
5. Output as a new collection of results

## Input and Output

* **Input**:
  * List / array-type data
* **Output**:
  * A collection of results generated by each round of execution

## Usage Rules

* The Iteration node must receive collection-type input
* Do not modify the original collection structure in the sub-workflow
* The iteration logic for each item should remain consistent

## Usage Recommendations

* Keep the logic for a single iteration as simple as possible
* Avoid nesting complex Agents within an iteration
* Pay attention to execution costs for large-scale lists

## Typical Scenarios

* Batch content generation
* Batch analysis and processing
* Item-by-item execution of list-type data
