# End Node

## What is it?

The End node is used in a Workflow to **mark the completion point of the flow**.
When the flow reaches the End node, the entire process stops running, and the final results are returned to the caller or the user.

This is the **terminal node** in the flow.

## What can you do with it?

#### 1. End Workflow Execution

The End node is used to explicitly tell the system:

* The current flow has been completed
* No further downstream nodes should be executed

Regardless of how complex the flow is, it should eventually terminate with an End node.

---

#### 2. Return Final Output Results

In the End node, you can:

* Select the variables or content that need to be returned
* Use the output of upstream nodes (such as the LLM node) as the final returned result

Examples:

* Return text generated by the model
* Return structured data (such as JSON)
* Return results after multi-step processing

---

#### 3. Unified Flow Exit

In flows containing conditional branches:

* Different branches can connect to the same End node
* Used to unify the final output and completion behavior of the flow

## Output Description

* The output of the End node is the **final output of the flow**
* Returned content will:

  * Be displayed to the user
  * Or serve as the response result for an API call
* If no return content is configured, the flow will execute but return no data

## Usage Rules

* A flow **requires at least one End node**
* The End node:

  * Cannot connect to downstream nodes
  * Can only serve as the endpoint of the flow
* A flow can have **multiple End nodes** (used to return different results for different branches)

## Usage Recommendations

* Explicitly specify the content you wish to return, avoiding the return of irrelevant variables
* For flows providing external APIs, it is recommended to return data in a clearly structured and stable format
* In multi-branch flows, ensure that every branch eventually leads to an End node

## Typical Scenarios

* Returning dialogue responses to the user
* Returning Agent execution results
* Returning final data after processing by tools or models
* Serving as the exit point for sub-workflows
