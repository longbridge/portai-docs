# Application Management (My Agent)

## Function Description

The **My Agent page** is used to manage all your Agent applications within the current workspace.

This is your main entry point for creating, viewing, and entering Agents.


## Application List

On the My Agent page, you can see:

* The **Agent application list** under the current workspace
* Each application represents an independent Agent
* Applications in different workspaces are isolated from each other and do not affect each other


## Supported Operations

On the My Agent page, you can:

* **Create Agent**
  * Create a new Agent application
* **Delete Agent**
  * Delete the Agent under the current workspace
* **Quick Entry**
  * Directly enter Agent Builder for editing, debugging, or viewing


## Relationship Between Applications and Workspaces

* Each Agent **can only belong to one workspace**
* Agents cannot be shared or moved across workspaces
* After switching workspaces, you will see the application list for that space


## Usage Tips

* Before creating an Agent, please confirm your current workspace
* Deleting an Agent is irreversible; please operate with caution
* Different workspaces can be used to distinguish different projects or purposes
