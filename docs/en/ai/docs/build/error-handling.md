# Error Handling

## Error Validation Before Publishing

Before an Agent is published, the platform performs an **error validation** on the current workflow:

* Validating whether the workflow structure is complete
* Validating whether critical nodes meet the running conditions
* Validating whether the workflow conforms to the requirements of the current type (ChatFlow / Workflow)

If there are issues that do not meet the publication criteria:

* The system will provide clear prompts on the interface
* And guide you to make corrections based on the prompts

## Usage Tips

* Please carefully review the validation information on the interface before publishing
* Ensure all errors and prompt items have been correctly handled
* It is recommended to proceed with formal publication only after the error validation has passed
